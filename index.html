                        <p>We moved here in 2021, and it's been an amazing journey since. Trinidad's beautiful scenery,
                            surrounded by the Rocky Mountains and wide open spaces, has really won us over. We love
                            being outdoors, whether it's hiking, kayaking, or just enjoying nature's beauty.</p>

                            and Duncan. They're more like family to us, bringing endless joy with their playful antics.
                            Did I mention we're also proud plant parents with over 200 houseplants that bring vibrance,
                            life, and an insane weekly watering schedule to our home?</p>

                            sharing meals, or going on spontaneous road trips, these moments make life richer. When
                            we're not out, we're pursuing our passions. We enjoy podcasts, audiobooks, video games, and
                            experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. We're always up for exploring and learning
                            something new.</p>
